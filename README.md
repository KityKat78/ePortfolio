Evidence is provided here of the following objectives:

1. Explain communication concepts and strategies

   In Week3, as a student, we were given listening scripts, where one student had to listen and the other had to respond, as per the instructions given by the teacher.      We learnt concepts and strategies by how the other student reacted when being given information as attached.[week3.docx](https://github.com/KityKat78/ePortfolio/files/8629389/week3.docx)

2. Show confidence and skills in oral communications and presentations

   Designed a powerpoint in [Week7COIT11239.pptx](https://github.com/KityKat78/ePortfolio/files/8628727/Week7COIT11239.pptx)  and presented the powerpoint in a video

3. Work effectively as part of a team

   Equally contributed a document [Week6MOBWriting.docx](https://github.com/KityKat78/ePortfolio/files/8628719/Week6MOBWriting.docx)
   for Professional Communication Skills for ICT

4. Communicate effectively in a professional context

   As a student, every week we have learnt how to communicate effectively in a professional context, so all documents provided for the other answers would be evidence to    show that effective, professional communication.  

5. Define and demonstrate conflict management and resolution strategies.

   In Week 4, as a student, I contributed in a group for Conflict Roleplays. [Wk4 Conflict Scenario.docx](https://github.com/KityKat78/ePortfolio/files/8628741/Wk4.Conflict.Scenario.docx)
